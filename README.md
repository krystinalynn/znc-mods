# znc-mods
Just some of the basic ZNC modules I'm working on. I'm not a developer, so expect these to be very basic and/or buggy. Feel free to fork and edit as needed.

### connect
This module allows commands to be issued anytime a client is attached to ZNC. 
**Note:** In order for the web functionality to work, you must copy the connect folder to /usr/share/znc or wherever your znc's web module files are located.
